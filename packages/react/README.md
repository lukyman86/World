# minikit-react

This package contains helper functions and components for building mini apps with React. This is not required to run a mini app and is only a convenience package for developers as it contains nice abstractions.

## 🚀 Getting Started

MiniKit is currently available on npm. To install, run:

```
pnpm i @worldcoin/minikit-react
```

For comprehensive setup instructions and usage examples, visit our [developer documentation](https://docs.world.org/mini-apps).

## 🛠 ️Developing Locally

To run the example mini app locally:

```
pnpm i
cd demo/with-next
pnpm dev
```

This will launch a demo mini app with all essential commands implemented, allowing you to explore and test the features.
