## Create a Mini App
[Mini apps](https://docs.worldcoin.org/mini-apps) enable third-party developers to create native-like applications within World App.

## Authentication

This starter kit uses [Minikit's](https://github.com/worldcoin/minikit-js) wallet auth to authenticate users, and [next-auth](https://authjs.dev/getting-started) to manage sessions.

## UI Library

This starter kit uses [Mini Apps UI Kit](https://github.com/worldcoin/mini-apps-ui-kit-react) to style the app. We recommend using the UI kit to make sure you follow [World App's design system](https://docs.world.org/mini-apps/design/app-guidelines).
